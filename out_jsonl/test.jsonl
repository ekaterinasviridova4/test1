{"input": "America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had. There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973. Something in the ballpark of 45 % of women who have abortions have more than one abortion. These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up. Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million. One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems. Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues. America 's innovation and education rankings would be lower. Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around. I 'm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion, its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those 55 million around. Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them? Its a complicated issue. Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population? Does n't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange, meaning that it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive? Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics? Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children. Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons, but surely its a significant number, so how many of these women would n't be having financial troubles if there was n't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower? This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value. Conclusion: Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding. *no that is n't a serious sentiment, i 'm just saying, this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point Then there is the next question. Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems, or would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit? Similar: An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus, but in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not. Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one. This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country. Modern technology like the internet must be considered. Yes, my view was changed, but not into the polar opposite. I am now confused and lost. I apologize for a few things that I did that could be considered *rude* around here. I also see a few times where I got redundant. Something in the ballpark of 45 % of women who have abortions have more than one abortion. These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up. What are you talking about? Do you really think abortions are only had by incompetent people who could n't be good parents? This appears to be a belief that has led you to conclude that America must be better off but you are really misinformed about the type of women who obtain abortions. That may be true. My thinking was that abortions were mainly required by unfortunate people, who in turn from their difficult circumstances, would 've raised the child to be the same. Can you counter that? I have a [ source] that shows that abortions are typically ( and in some years, mostly) had by people without enough wealth to care for there kids. Sure, hopefully I can find some sources to support this argument as well, otherwise I may have to change my mind! ( Here is a well sourced link to some stats about women who have abortions) Some stats for example include\" 31 % of women obtaining abortions are in school 68 % of women who have abortions are employed. 33 % of women who obtain abortions have family incomes under $ 11,000 annually, 11 % of abortions are obtained by women whose household incomes are $ 50,000 or more. So that means the majority of those having abortions have income between $ 11,000 and $ 55,000, which is above the Federal Poverty line. I ca n't confirm but I do recall reading once that a common reason for women to abort is becoming pregnant too soon after having a child. It could be about finances but could just be too soon for a woman to go through again. Pregnancy is hard on the body and far riskier than an abortion performed within a few weeks.", "output": "<Implicit> America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had. </Implicit> <Explicit> There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973. </Explicit> <Explicit> Something in the ballpark of 45 % of women who have abortions have more than one abortion. </Explicit> <Implicit> These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up. </Implicit> <Implicit> Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million. </Implicit> <Implicit> One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems. </Implicit> <Implicit> Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues. </Implicit> <Implicit> America 's innovation and education rankings would be lower. </Implicit> <Implicit> Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around. </Implicit> <Implicit> I 'm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion, its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point </Implicit> <Explicit> what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those 55 million around. </Explicit> <Implicit> Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them?

{"input": "America is not a democracy. Really though. There is an unchecked organization that spies on them 24/7 without consent. The US has given itself license to detain and torture citizens with no trial. The energy laws in that country allow corporations to drill where they please and, as a result, poison who they please. American citizens have clearly been lied to in many situations. These lies have led to events like the second gulf war. Not to mention the completely unregulated financial system. Honestly, none of these things have been democratically voted for, so why are Americans so deluded about this? It 's not a free, democratic society by any means. It 's clearly an oligarchy. A democracy is not necessarily a functional, benevolent government, nor is a democracy necessarily free. The USA was intended to be a federal republic, a republic being a form of indirect democracy. To see if it actually *is* one ( at least the\" republic\" part), we just need to answer a few simple questions. Is political power in the US held by elected officials? Are those officials elected in free and fair democratic elections? The answer to both of those questions is unambiguously\" yes.\" The domestic spying, the secret courts, the torture, the corporate favoritism, the environmental destruction, the lies, the unjustified wars, the unregulated financial system ... all of those are things instituted or approved by our democratically elected officials, fully within the scope of power ceded to them by the constitution. And we continue to vote those who do these things into office in free and fair elections, time and time again, without fail. You can argue, perhaps successfully, that the US is a fascist, un-free state, but it remains by definition a democratic one. Fair enough haha. This is the best argument I 've seen here but how can you have truly fair elections if things like superpacs exist? What 's your basis for believing that SuperPACs make elections un-free or un-fair? Well in my brain a fair election is when anyone can run for office. The fact that you need millions of dollars to do so seems unfair. It instantly results in a situation where only the rich can run for and hold offices. On the municipal level I do n't think superpacs are a problem, but definitely on a federal level. Anyone *can* run for office. You might not get very far, but you can run. And you do n't need millions of dollars, you need to be *able to raise* millions of dollars. In itself, I do n't see a problem with that. Raising large amounts of money requires leadership, diplomacy, organization, charisma… all traits I like to see in my elected officials. The corruption and lack of transparency created by PACs and SuperPACs and Citizens United in general is definitely a major problem but like some other things that have come up in this discussion, it 's not an issue that makes the USA an un-democratic state. There 's no rule saying that the person who raises the most money wins the election. The fact that most people vote for the most visible candidate on their side rather than the one that most closely represents their interests is a problem with the electorate and also a result of our winner-take-all voting system, but neither of those are in conflict with the USA being a democracy by definition. Okay, I think you have officially Changed My View haha ... it seems like the problem is more caused by the populace not being responsible voters, I see that and agree with it. Ideally I would like it if no money was involved in the poltical process, but that is naive. I 'm pissed off about the way things are in America, as I 'm sure you are, and I always think that the best way to address a problem is to see it for what it is. America 's problem is n't that it is n't a democracy; rather, I think that America 's problem is that it has fetishized democracy to the point where anything resulting from that system is accepted, even if it 's corrupt and tyrannical, and that 's exactly what it 's turning into. No, we 're probably never going to get money out of politics entirely, but corporations being able to anonymously fund entire campaigns is a major threat to healthy government, even if it is n't, strictly speaking, un-democratic. Maybe I put forward the wrong view, but I think you and I more or less agree that their is something fetid in the system.

Why is the end of our current economic paradigm not followed by a new one? The reason that the end of our current economic paradigm wo n't be followed by a new one is because there is nothing for us to do after the machines are doing all of the service jobs we are currently losing. Machines do n't have money either so they wo n't bother buying services from us. Cryptocurrency may help a little because it would allow servers to be able to buy and sell things, but once they can administrate their own systems what is the use of humans. When that happens, the corporations which produce and deliver food will no longer have an incentive to do so. The cities will suffer great hunger and it will be the end of Man. Yes food shortages would be difficult in a city but if it got that bad why would n't people just leave the city and form small communities that farmed their own food? Why would it be the end of man?

{"input": "Most democracies are far too tolerant of extremism, especially the likes of neo-fascism, neo-nazism, radical Islamism and violent intolerance. The world has been to soft on these ideologies and they need to be eliminated whenever they appear. I think some of the biggest threats to global stability comes from the political fringes. It 's either the extreme left, or the extreme right. Radicalism almost always leads to violence, and is a plague on democratic society and governments. Since communism has been relegated to just a handful of countries, the far-left has for the most part been dealt with. However the far-right continues to be a menace. I believe fascist neo-nazi groups, the KKK, the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the far-right. These groups are always extreme fringes, and a handful of people make the world a much nastier place. Often it is the leaders of such movements that prey on the weak-willed, using them as pawns in their ambitions of power. Unfortunately with the world 's obsession with free speech and personal liberty, such leaders are given a free hand. On websites like twitter and facebook we see ISIS recruit blind followers. Would n't restricting\" free speech\" put brakes on this sort of recruitment? Political parties in democracies often try to keep these groups on a leash, but do not wish to eliminate them since they serve definite political goals like polarizing the electorate. I see this as a major flaw in democracy. Fear of losing votes from radical sympathizers leads to political groups appeasing extremism. Instead, I think governments should do much more and try to completely stamp out any signs of fascism. After the horrors of World War 2 I find it completely absurd that we still put up with their ideologies. Bringing socio-economic growth to communities that feel disenfranchised just is n't enough, and their will always be a few bad apples. These bad apples need to be weeded out. Instead, we allow them to spread their rot, and infect society. I think some of the biggest threats to global stability comes from the political fringes. The only constant is change. Global stability is a myth grown out of a population that has gotten good at balancing acts. The supports necessary for real stability simply do n't exist. To carry out a balancing act, you have to avoid any extreme reactions, as they only make for larger oscillations. Censorship is an extreme reaction to an extreme force, and here are two very good arguments for why should be seen as an extreme option: There are many things we used to consider extreme that are now fundamental principles of our society. We claim that our old positions were wrong, and have good evidence to back this up. With this in mind, we are forced to acknowledge that we are probably making errors in other places, and may even have been led astray in one of the areas we have already changed. Censorship halts this process and locks in whatever is current. Censorship does not eliminate the censored individual. Indeed, they will work hard to evade the censor, carrying out their activities further from the public eye. This brings their arguments out of public discourse, where a solid counter-argument is more likely to be interjected. It also dooms any attempt to change their beliefs, as their opponents no longer understand those beliefs sufficiently to do this. Finally it gives them a true claim that they are being oppressed and targeted, which history suggests tends to strengthen a group. Good arguments. Although I may disagree somewhat, I see why censorship can be dangerous. One thing about censorship: do n't you think it 's a problem that the likes of ISIS some neo-nazi groups actively recruit on twitter and facebook? Should't this sort of thing be stopped? There are many things we used to consider extreme that are now fundamental principles of our society. While this may be true, has n't the killing of innocents ( and murder or rape, or destruction of property) always been considered deeply immoral ( outside of wars)? We already clamp down on extremism, and potential extremists are actively monitored using existing surveillance techniques.
